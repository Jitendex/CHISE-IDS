This directory holds the CHISE-IDS package which contains data and
utilities about structures of Han Ideographs (漢字).


# How to install

Please install [CL-CHISE](https://gitlab.chise.org/CHISE/cl-chise).

Note that if you install CL-CHISE in SBCL, CL-CHISE installs this
package automatically.


You can also use this package with XEmacs CHISE.
If XEmacs CHISE is installed in your system, please type

    % make install

in the directory of the CHISE-IDS distribution.

[Note] If you don't have XEmacs CHISE, the CHISE-base package may be
useful.  It is an installer package to install CHISE functionalities
including libchise, XEmacs CHISE, the CHISE-IDS package, some other
Emacs Lisp utilities, some fonts, etc.  It is available at:

	http://www.chise.org/dist/base/

In these files, each line represents an abstract character, and each
component used in IDS should be abstract characters.

If a component is unified two or more CJK Unified Ideographs by UCV,
one CJK Unified Ideograph represents the abstract component
(semantically it indicates the abstract component unified by UCV, not
the abstract character itself).


## IDS files for glyphs

    IDS-UCS-Compat.txt	CJK Compatibility Ideographs

In these files, each line represents a glyph unified by the
corresponding CJK Unified Ideograph, not an abstract character.  So
each component should be a glyph.  If a CJK Unified Ideograph
indicates the unique and concrete glyph, it is used as a glyph
component.  But a CJK Unified Ideograph unifies two or more glyphs,
one glyph object of the CHISE character ontology is used.  In that
case, glyphs are represented by entity-reference format.  Note that
even if a component can be encoded by a CJK Unified Ideograph, it may
be encoded as an entity-reference to indicate the corresponding glyph
of the CHISE character ontology.  In that case, it is **not** bug!
Don't send Pull/Merge-Request or issues to convert an entity-reference
to the corresponding CJK Unified Ideographs!


## Format

These files are encoded by UTF-8.  The format of each line of the
files is:

    <CODEPOINT><TAB><CHARACTER><TAB><IDS>(<TAB>@apparent=<IDS>)

or

    ;; <COMMENTS>

Each element means

    <TAB>	<HORIZONTAL TABULATION> (U+0009)
    <CODEPOINT>	code point
		U+hhhh		Hex form of UCS code point
				(U+0000 〜 U+FFFF)
		U-hhhhhhhh	Hex form of UCS code point
				(U+00000000 〜 U+7FFFFFFF)
    <CHARACTER>	character corresponding with <CODEPOINT>
    <IDS>	Ideographic Description Sequence
		(based on ISO/IEC 10646-1:2000 F.3.1; however
		Compatibility Ideographs and non-UCS Ideographs are
		also allowed)
    <COMMENTS>	comment

`(<TAB>@apparent=<IDS>)` is an optional field.  `@apparent=<IDS>` means
that the `<IDS>` represents an apparent structure.  Not that the `<IDS>`
stored in the 3rd field may be regarded as functional structure.
